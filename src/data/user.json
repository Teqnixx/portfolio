Built with modern web technologies, the system also includes a job skill matchmaking algorithm and schedule prediction tool to optimize internship placements and planning. The research proved highly effective, significantly improving operational efficiency, enhancing collaboration among stakeholders, and elevating the overall internship experience for students and partner organizations.",
